Hi Jenney,

I am sending the project has a zip file and has link to GitHub.

Thank you for the test I never got to play Ludo, I also took the change to try a new library called libgdx. 
It prooved to be a bad idea because it caused me some problems like not beeing able to detect touches  

To surpasse this issue I made the game play against itself hope its ok.

Best regards,

Ricardo
